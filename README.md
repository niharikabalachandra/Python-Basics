## Introduction

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

## Is Python installed on my computer?

To check that Python is installed, open a command line (*typically by running the
"Terminal" program on MAC **or** Win + R keys on your keyboard. Then, type cmd or cmd.exe and press Enter or click/tap OK*) and type "python -V" 

If you see some version information, then you have Python installed already. 

However, if you get "bash: python: command not found", there is possibility
that Python is not installed on your computer. 

## [Installation:](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XBcFYv_MVZcdNovO7G1LrebA7kAqHYkWAAkGFl3cgm0/edit?usp=sharing) 

Mac OS X and Linux comes pre installed with python. Windows users can download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

To install IPython run,

    $ pip install ipython[all]
    
This will install all the necessary dependencies for the notebook, qtconsole, tests etc.

### Installation from unofficial distributions [Recommended]

Installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome. Anaconda and Canopy comes pre packaged with all the necessary python libraries and also IPython.

#### Anaconda

Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ 

Anaconda is completely free and includes more than 300 python packages. Both python 2.7 and 3.6 options are available. We'll work in version 3.6

## Launching Jupyter Notebook

From the terminal

    Jupyter notebook

Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them

    Cell > All Output > Clear
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.
